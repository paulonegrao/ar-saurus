# ar-saurus
AR to play videos &amp; other web based Augmented Reality elements on customized markers.
## Description
The app combines AR.js and A-Frame solutions to introduce Augmented Reality objects in a real scene. In this particular context, it will insert video and audio into real scenarios captured through the lens of smartphones cameras and/or desktop's webcams.
To launch the AR, the app uses a combination of customized QR code and anchor marker. The first will direct the user to a Heroku URL that hosts the AR-Saurus app. The second will server like an anchor reference to the AR objects (in this case, a video/audio media).

## Usage
The best way to use the app is:
1. Print the customized markers (QR and anchor)
1. Use a device camera to frame up the markers to direct you to the AR-Saurus URL (https://ar-saurus.herokuapp.com/)
* **Smartphones:** the QR code will direct you to the AR-Saurus URL. After landing the AR-Saurus app and accepting the confirmation msgs, you should touch the video object that will appear right above the markers in order to play the video.
* **Desktops:** go to your favorite browser and navigate to the AR-Saurus URL. Keep the markers framed up by the webcam and the video will automatically start playing.
